#Brie - an automaton for the chronically lazy and the ever forgetful.

Presently in beta, this scraper pulls data from websites as per user preference.
Episodes of 720p are queued by default and settings for quality are on the way.


#Dependencies 
	* requests - "HTTP for Humans" - A Pythonic library for HTTP/1.1 requests.
	* BeautifulSoup - Python library for quick "screen-scraping".
	* json - A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoder and decoder for uniform data exchange (think config files).
	* re - Regular Expression operations for Python.
	* Possibly many more...

#v0.9
	* Pulls data from one website (highly breakable).
	* Prints data to STDOUT, in no formatted way (working on reducing this).
	* JSON supported for config files.

#TODO
	* Automatic client invoke.
	* Shell script wrapper.
	* Episode quality selection.
	* Integration and V&V.
